Hello,

I am writing to introduce **CLEVER°FLOW**, an Agentic, Event-driven Platform for automating Operational Documents.

### What is Operational Documentation?
Operational documentation is the written documentation necessary to operate a business. Examples include onboarding processes, reclamation policies, and documentation of internal, technical knowledge for manufacturing or troubleshooting. 
Operational documentation is relevant for the vast majority of employees in the company.

### What does it mean “Automation of Operational Documents”?
Human writers create Operational Documents for future use in the desired business context. 
Automation bridges the gap between documentation and its use.

### Why is it important to automate Operational Documents?
Automation enables a Single Place of Truth for both documentation and its use:
- Content writers can visualize and test the logic of their documents at the time of composition.
- Supporters can visually find and prove the answer to an input query with the given documents in their daily business.
- Technicians can integrate ad hoc Agentic Solutions into these documents to enable interactivity and automatic processing.

### Who are we?
CLEVER°FLOW plays a central role in documenting and reasoning Technical and Support Documents within our CLEVER°NOW Eco-System (https://clevernow.com).
